# sys-botbase-port6001
olliz0r's sys-botbase for the Nintendo Switch, compiled to open port 6001

Replace the exefs.nsp from the original repo to connect to your cfw Switch on port 6001.
I compiled this because I was having trouble connecting to 2 switches from one pc. Now I have one on port 6000 and one on port 6001.
